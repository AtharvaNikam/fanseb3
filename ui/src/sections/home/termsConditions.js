      Payouts for eligible earnings will be processed on a monthly or periodic
      basis within timelines communicated by Fanseb from time to time. “Eligible
      earnings” means commissions earnings calculated on net order value after
      deduction of returns or cancellations, if any, which have been
      communicated to Fanseb by the brand. Fanseb will process your payout only
      after receiving confirmations data from the brands.
      <br />
      For example, when your audience places an order on 25th of March amounting
      to order value of, say INR 5,000/- from a Fanseb brand say “XYZ” but
      returns a few items from the order on 5th April of value INR 2,000/-. Now,
      supposedly XYZ shares the above order data on 15th April, then eligible
      earnings for this order would be calculated on order value of INR 3,000/-
      and these earnings would be considered for the payouts month of April,
      which would be paid in the first week of May, subject to fanseb’s payouts
      processing date.
